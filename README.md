# Fluid Inclusions Programs

Isochore.py:
Isochore.py is a command-line Python program written in Python 3 that calculates fluid inclusion isochores for a
fluid inclusion in the system NaCl-H2O. References: Bodnar & Vytik (1994) and Atkinson (2002).
Homogenization temperature (Th) values up to 484 °C
Salinity range: 0 to 40 mass %. equivalent in NaCl

USAGE:

Access the the directory where isochore.py is stored
In the terminal prompt, execute: 'python isochore.py'
The results are saved as a CSV file in the same directory

Salinity.py:
Salinity.py is command-line Python program written in Python 3 that calculates fluid inclusion salinities 
for several fluid inclusions simultaneously.
This software calculate salinities using ice-melting temperatures for aqueous-electrolitic fluids 
in the system NaCl-H2O, for salinities up to 23 % in mass.

USAGE:

Access the the directory where isochore.py is stored
In the terminal prompt, execute: 'python isochore.py filename'
files must be saved in the CSV file format, with data structured in three columns: 'id, Th, TmIce'
The results are saved as a CSV file in the same directory
